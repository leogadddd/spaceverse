Request to use your YouTube video as an embedded background for my web app



I hope this email finds you well. My name is Jann Leo Gadil, and I am a graduating ComSci college student and a developer of a web app called Spaceverse. I recently used one of your YouTube videos as a background in the old version of my app as an experiment to see how it would look. However, I did not have your permission to use it, and I apologize for any inconvenience or concern that may have caused.

Now, as I continue to develop my app as a hobby project, I would like to formally request your permission to use your video as an embedded background in my app. I was very impressed with your video titled "Spend The Night In An Exclusive Luxury Miami Apartment | Heavy Rain & Thunder Sounds Outside | 4K" and think it would be an excellent addition to my app.

I understand the importance of properly attributing your work, and I would be happy to add links to both your video and channel in my app, so that viewers can easily access and view your original content.

If you grant me permission to use your video, please let me know what credit information you would like me to include, such as your name, channel name, and any other relevant details.

I understand that you may have concerns about the use of your content, and I want to emphasize that I fully respect your ownership and copyright rights. If you have any questions or concerns about my request, please do not hesitate to let me know.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Best regards, Jann Leo Gadil
